To address these issues, we will develop a comprehensive and robust AI-based generative search system which will be capable of effectively and accurately answering questions from a PDF document. This innovative approach allows users to pose precise, context-aware questions and receive accurate answers directly from the text. By improving efficiency, accuracy, and accessibility, the system enhances document management and data retrieval, which may be useful in various sectors such as legal, financial, medical, and academic etc.<br>\n","\n","This system will utilize the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, which combines embedding, search and ranking, and generative layers to provide comprehensive and contextually relevant answers. </div>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"B9jze2fMefs-"},"source":["### **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):**\n","<div align=\"justify\"> RAG is the process of optimizing the output of a large language model, so it references an authoritative knowledge base outside of its training data sources before generating a response. Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast volumes of data and use billions of parameters to generate original output for tasks like answering questions, translating languages, and completing sentences. It is a cost-effective approach to improving LLM output, so it remains relevant, accurate, and useful in various

**1. Embedding Layer:**\n","\n","<div align=\"justify\"> The embedding layer is the first layer of a RAG model, and it contains an embedding model that is trained on a massive data set of text and code. Embedding layer is responsible for processing text from document and converting it into meaningful vector embeddings using different chunking strategies and embedding models. This layer is an important part of RAG models because it allows our system to understand the meaning of the text that it is processing and understand its semantic relationship to the query. The embedding layer generates embeddings for our text corpus and allows the RAG model to understand the meaning of the query and to generate a relevant and informative response.<br>\n","\n","#### **Document Processing:**\n","The PDF document will be processed, cleaned, and chunked into smaller parts for embedding.<br>\n","\n","#### **Chunking Strategy:**\n","Several chunking strategies will be tested to find the optimal method that balances the trade-off between chunk size and information retention.<br>\n","\n","#### **Embedding Models:**\n","Embedding models from Hugging face will be evaluated. Here we focus on selecting the model that provides the most accurate, reliable and contextually relevant embeddings for the chunks.<br>\n","\n","###**2. Search and Rank Layer:**\n","The next layer or second layer is the search and rank or the re-rank layer. Search layer focuses on embedding the queries, performing a vector search using ChromaDB, implementing cache mechanism, and applying re-ranking to retrieve the most relevant information or responses. This layer is an essential component of RAG because it ensures that the retrieved text is accurate, relevant and contextually appropriate. This layer typically consists of two components: A search component that uses various techniques to retrieve relevant documents from the knowledge base and a re-rank component that uses a variety of techniques to re-rank the retrieved documents to produce the most relevant results.<br>\n","\n","#### **Query Design:**\n","In search and rank layer some queries will be created based on the content of the policy document. These queries will be designed to test the system’s ability to retrieve relevant information.<br>\n","\n","#### **Query Embedding and Search:**\n","Queries will be embedded and searched against the ChromaDB vector database. The search results will be ranked, and the top results will be selected for further processing.<br>\n","\n","#### **Cache Mechanism:**\n","A Cache mechanism will be implemented to store and retrieve frequently accessed queries efficiently.<br>\n","\n","#### **Re-Ranking:**\n","The search results will be re-ranked using cross-encoding models from Hugging Face to ensure the most relevant chunks are selected.<br>\n","\n","### **3. Generation Layer:**\n","The generation layer is the last layer of a RAG model which consists of a foundation large language model that is trained on a massive data set of text and code. Generation layer generates the final answers using a comprehensive prompt designed to leverage the retrieved chunks and optimize response quality.<br>\n","\n","#### **Prompt Design:**\n","A detailed and exhaustive prompt will be created to guide Large Language Model (LLM) in generating the responses.<br>\n","\n","#### **Few-Shot Examples:**\n","To improve the quality of the generated answers, few-shot examples may be included in the prompt.<br>\n","\n","#### **Final Output:**\n","The system will generate a final answer for each query based on the retrieved

If The Principal believes a person is not legally able to give a valid receipt, as determined by The Principal, for a payment, and no guardian has been appointed, The Principal may pay whoever has assumed the care and support of the person. Article 5 - Settlement of Proceeds When The Principal receives Written proof of the Member's death, the Scheduled Benefit (or approved amount, if applicable) in force for the Member, less any Accelerated Benefit payment as described in PART IV, Section A, Article 7 will be placed in an interest-bearing draft account at an interest rate determined by The Principal, unless a lump sum or other settlement option has been elected. With the interest-bearing draft account, the balance will be available to the beneficiary at any time, in total or in part, subject to the following terms: a. withdrawals must be made by draft furnished by The Principal; and b. the draft amount must be at least $500 or more and may not exceed the account balance; and c. if the account balance falls below $500, the balance will be paid to the beneficiary in a lump sum and the account closed; and d. the account cannot be assigned or used as collateral. The Interest Draft Account will not be available if the Scheduled Benefit amount payable is $5,000 or less; or if the beneficiary is anything other than a natural person. In these instances, a lump sum payment will be made. In the event the Interest Draft Account is not available or otherwise does not apply, The Principal reserves the right to make payment of proceeds according to other settlement options if agreed to, in Writing, by The Principal.

In no event will Dependent Life Insurance be in force for a Member who is not insured for Member Life Insurance. b. If a Dependent spouse is in a Period of Limited Activity on the date Dependent Life Insurance or an increase in Dependent Life Insurance Scheduled Benefit due to a change in the Member's Annual Compensation or insurance class would otherwise be effective, such insurance or increase will not be in force for that Dependent spouse until the Period of Limited Activity ends. However, this Period of Limited Activity requirement may be waived as described below. When insurance under this Group Policy replaces coverage under a Prior Policy, the Period of Limited Activity requirement may be waived for those Dependent spouses' who: (1) are eligible and enrolled under this Group Policy on its Date of Issue; and (2) were covered under the Prior Policy on the date of its termination. In no event will the Period of Limited Activity requirement be waived for those Dependent spouses' who, on the date of termination of the Prior Policy had the option, under the terms of the Prior Policy, to convert their coverage, under the Prior Policy, to an individual policy. NOTE: When insurance under this Group Policy replaces coverage under a Prior Policy and the Period of Limited Activity requirement is waived, any benefits payable will be the lesser of the Scheduled Benefit of this Group Policy or the amount that would have been paid by the Prior Policy had it remained in force. c. If insurance is requested under this Group Policy for a Dependent spouse that was eligible under the Prior Policy, but elected to waive coverage under the Prior Policy. d. If a Dependent is confined in a Hospital or Skilled Nursing Facility on the date an increase in the Dependent Life Insurance Scheduled Benefit would otherwise be effective, the Scheduled Benefit in force for the Dependent will continue to apply to the Dependent until such confinement ends. When the Hospital or Skilled Nursing Facility confinement ends, the Scheduled Benefit increase will then be in force for the Dependent. e. Any required Proof of Good Health will be with respect to the health of the Member's Dependents. f. If Dependent Life Insurance is in force for a Dependent of the Member, a Member will be insured with respect to a new Dependent (other than a newborn child) on the date the new Dependent is acquired, provided the new Dependent is not then confined in a Hospital or Skilled Nursing Facility.

If the Policyholder has other group insurance with The Principal, and if life coverage is initially added on a date other than the Policy Anniversary and it is more than six months before the next Policy Anniversary, The Principal reserves the right to change the premium rate on the next Policy Anniversary. Written notice will be given to the Policyholder at least 31 days before the date of change. If the Policyholder agrees to participate in the electronic services program of The Principal and, at a later date elects to withdraw from participation, such withdrawal may result in certain administrative fees being charged to the Policyholder. Article 4 - Premium Amount The amount of premium to be paid on each due date will be determined in these ways: a. Member Life Insurance The total volume of insurance in force will be divided by 1,000. The result will then be multiplied by the premium rate then in effect. b. Member Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance The total volume of insurance in force will be divided by 1,000. The result will then be multiplied by the premium rate then in effect. c.

Individual Policy If a Member qualifies and makes timely application, he or she may convert the group coverage by purchasing an individual policy of life insurance under these terms: (1) The Member will not be required to submit Proof of Good Health. (2) The policy will be for life insurance only. No disability or other benefits will be included. (3) The policy will be on one of the forms, other than term insurance, then issued by The Principal to persons in the risk class to which the Member belongs on the individual policy's effective date. (4) Premium will be based on the Member's age and the standard rate of The Principal for the policy form to be issued. b. Purchase Qualification A Member will qualify for individual purchase if insurance under this Group Policy terminates and: (1) the Member's total Life Insurance, or any portion of it, terminates because he or she ends Active Work or ceases to be in a class eligible for insurance; or (2) after the Member has been continuously insured under this Group Policy for at least five years, his or her total Member Life Insurance terminates because this Group Policy terminates or is amended to exclude the Member's insurance class; or (3) the Member's Coverage During Disability as described in PART IV, Section A, ceases because Total Disability ends and he or she does not return to Active Work within 31 days; or (4) the Member's Accelerated Benefits Premium Waiver Period as described in PART IV, Section A, ceases and he or she does not qualify for Coverage During Disability . c. Application/Effective Date Notice of the individual purchase right must be given to the Member by the Policyholder before insurance under this Group Policy terminates, or as soon as reasonably possible thereafter. A Member must apply for individual purchase and the first premium for the individual policy must be paid to The Principal within 31 days after the date Member Life Insurance or Coverage During Disability terminates under this Group Policy. This policy has been updated effective January 1, 2014 PART III - INDIVIDUAL REQUIREMENTS AND RIGHTS GC 6011 Section F - Individual Purchase Rights, Page 1\",\n          \"b . on any date the definition of Member or Dependent is changed; and c. on any date the Policyholder's business, as specified on the Policyholder application, is changed; and d. on any date that a schedule of insurance or class of insured Members is changed; and e. on any premium due date, if the Policyholder has been receiving a multiple policy discount rate and the Policyholder drops below the minimum number of coverages to receive such discount rate; and f. on any date the premium contribution required of Members is changed; and g. with respect to Member Life Insurance, on any Policy Anniversary, if the average age, average Scheduled Benefit amount, or the male/female distribution for then insured Members has changed since the last Policy Anniversary; and h. on any Policy Anniversary, if the volume of insurance for then insured Members has increased or decreased by more than 25% since the last Policy Anniversary. If the Policyholder has other group insurance with The Principal, and if life coverage is initially added on a date other than the Policy Anniversary and it is more than six months before the next Policy Anniversary, The Principal reserves the right to change the premium rate on the next Policy Anniversary. Written notice will be given to the Policyholder at least 31 days before the date of change. If the Policyholder agrees to participate in the electronic services program of The Principal and, at a later date elects to withdraw from participation, such withdrawal may result in certain administrative fees being charged to the Policyholder. Article 4 - Premium Amount The amount of premium to be paid on each due date will be determined in these ways: a. Member Life Insurance The total volume of insurance in force will be divided by 1,000. The result will then be multiplied by the premium rate then in effect. b. Member Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance The total volume of insurance in force will be divided by 1,000. The result will then be multiplied by the premium rate then in effect. c. Dependent Life Insurance This policy has been updated effective January 1, 2014 PART II - POLICY ADMINISTRATION GC 6004 Section B - Premiums, Page 2\",\n          \"a . In no event will Dependent Life Insurance be in force for a Member who is not insured for Member Life Insurance. b. If a Dependent spouse is in a Period of Limited Activity on the date Dependent Life Insurance or an increase in Dependent Life Insurance Scheduled Benefit due to a change in the Member's Annual Compensation or insurance class would otherwise be effective, such insurance or increase will not be in force for that Dependent spouse until the Period of Limited Activity ends. However, this Period of Limited Activity requirement may be waived as described below. When insurance under this Group Policy replaces coverage under a Prior Policy, the Period of Limited Activity requirement may be waived for those Dependent spouses' who: (1) are eligible and enrolled under this Group Policy on its Date of Issue; and (2) were covered under the Prior Policy on the date of its termination. In no event will the Period of Limited Activity requirement be waived for those Dependent spouses' who, on the date of termination of the Prior Policy had the option, under the terms of the Prior Policy, to convert their coverage, under the Prior Policy, to an individual policy. NOTE: When insurance under this Group Policy replaces coverage under a Prior Policy and the Period of Limited Activity requirement is waived, any benefits payable will be the lesser of the Scheduled Benefit of this Group Policy or the amount that would have been paid by the Prior Policy had it remained in force. c. If insurance is requested under this Group Policy for a Dependent spouse that was eligible under the Prior Policy, but elected to waive coverage under the Prior Policy. d. If a Dependent is confined in a Hospital or Skilled Nursing Facility on the date an increase in the Dependent Life Insurance Scheduled Benefit would otherwise be effective, the Scheduled Benefit in force for the Dependent will continue to apply to the Dependent until such confinement ends. When the Hospital or Skilled Nursing Facility confinement ends, the Scheduled Benefit increase will then be in force for the Dependent. e. Any required Proof of Good Health will be with respect to the health of the Member's Dependents. f. If Dependent Life Insurance is in force for a Dependent of the Member, a Member will be insured with respect to a new Dependent (other than a newborn child) on the date the new Dependent is acquired, provided the new Dependent is not then confined in a Hospital or Skilled Nursing Facility.

Individual Policy If a Member qualifies and makes timely application, he or she may convert the group coverage by purchasing an individual policy of life insurance under these terms: (1) The Member will not be required to submit Proof of Good Health. (2) The policy will be for life insurance only. No disability or other benefits will be included. (3) The policy will be on one of the forms, other than term insurance, then issued by The Principal to persons in the risk class to which the Member belongs on the individual policy's effective date. (4) Premium will be based on the Member's age and the standard rate of The Principal for the policy form to be issued. b. Purchase Qualification A Member will qualify for individual purchase if insurance under this Group Policy terminates and: (1) the Member's total Life Insurance, or any portion of it, terminates because he or she ends Active Work or ceases to be in a class eligible for insurance; or (2) after the Member has been continuously insured under this Group Policy for at least five years, his or her total Member Life Insurance terminates because this Group Policy terminates or is amended to exclude the Member's insurance class; or (3) the Member's Coverage During Disability as described in PART IV, Section A, ceases because Total Disability ends and he or she does not return to Active Work within 31 days; or (4) the Member's Accelerated Benefits Premium Waiver Period as described in PART IV, Section A, ceases and he or she does not qualify for Coverage During Disability . c. Application/Effective Date Notice of the individual purchase right must be given to the Member by the Policyholder before insurance under this Group Policy terminates, or as soon as reasonably possible thereafter. A Member must apply for individual purchase and the first premium for the individual policy must be paid to The Principal within 31 days after the date Member Life Insurance or Coverage During Disability terminates under this Group Policy.

If the Policyholder has other group insurance with The Principal, and if life coverage is initially added on a date other than the Policy Anniversary and it is more than six months before the next Policy Anniversary, The Principal reserves the right to change the premium rate on the next Policy Anniversary. Written notice will be given to the Policyholder at least 31 days before the date of change. If the Policyholder agrees to participate in the electronic services program of The Principal and, at a later date elects to withdraw from participation, such withdrawal may result in certain administrative fees being charged to the Policyholder. Article 4 - Premium Amount The amount of premium to be paid on each due date will be determined in these ways: a. Member Life Insurance The total volume of insurance in force will be divided by 1,000. The result will then be multiplied by the premium rate then in effect. b. Member Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance The total volume of insurance in force will be divided by 1,000. The result will then be multiplied by the premium rate then in effect. c. Dependent Life Insurance This policy has been updated effective January 1, 2014 PART II - POLICY ADMINISTRATION GC 6004 Section B - Premiums, Page 2\",\n          \"a . In no event will Dependent Life Insurance be in force for a Member who is not insured for Member Life Insurance. b. If a Dependent spouse is in a Period of Limited Activity on the date Dependent Life Insurance or an increase in Dependent Life Insurance Scheduled Benefit due to a change in the Member's Annual Compensation or insurance class would otherwise be effective, such insurance or increase will not be in force for that Dependent spouse until the Period of Limited Activity ends. However, this Period of Limited Activity requirement may be waived as described below. When insurance under this Group Policy replaces coverage under a Prior Policy, the Period of Limited Activity requirement may be waived for those Dependent spouses' who: (1) are eligible and enrolled under this Group Policy on its Date of Issue; and (2) were covered under the Prior Policy on the date of its termination. In no event will the Period of Limited Activity requirement be waived for those Dependent spouses' who, on the date of termination of the Prior Policy had the option, under the terms of the Prior Policy, to convert their coverage, under the Prior Policy, to an individual policy. NOTE: When insurance under this Group Policy replaces coverage under a Prior Policy and the Period of Limited Activity requirement is waived, any benefits payable will be the lesser of the Scheduled Benefit of this Group Policy or the amount that would have been paid by the Prior Policy had it remained in force. c. If insurance is requested under this Group Policy for a Dependent spouse that was eligible under the Prior Policy, but elected to waive coverage under the Prior Policy. d. If a Dependent is confined in a Hospital or Skilled Nursing Facility on the date an increase in the Dependent Life Insurance Scheduled Benefit would otherwise be effective, the Scheduled Benefit in force for the Dependent will continue to apply to the Dependent until such confinement ends. When the Hospital or Skilled Nursing Facility confinement ends, the Scheduled Benefit increase will then be in force for the Dependent. e. Any required Proof of Good Health will be with respect to the health of the Member's Dependents. f. If Dependent Life Insurance is in force for a Dependent of the Member, a Member will be insured with respect to a new Dependent (other than a newborn child) on the date the new Dependent is acquired, provided the new Dependent is not then confined in a Hospital or Skilled Nursing Facility.
